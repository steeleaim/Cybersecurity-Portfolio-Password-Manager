# Cybersecurity-Portfolio-Password-Manager

This python project demonstrates basic password management utilising dictionary and key/value pairs. In this case username was key and password was value.
hashlib and getpass modules are used - getpass recognises input str as a password. Hashlib is used to hash password for security using sha526 hashing algorithm.
Users can create an account by specifying their username and password. Users can then login using their username and the program checks whether their password attempt matches hashed password.
